//256MB of memory for buffers, approx 2 second of HDD write
//the buffer size in bytes can be any even multiple of 256^2 that is creater
//than or equal to 2097152 bytes (2MB). The factor of 256^2 comes from the
//following calculations. The CRC32 I use digests 1024 bytes of data to generate
//4 bytes of data so the crc takes 1/256 the size that the data takes. then if
//the buffer size is x bytes, it can be divided into a header section and a
//data section. The header section contains some basic metadata and the crc.
//If the data section takes 255*x/256 bytes that leaves x/256 bytes for the
//header. Of that x/256 bytes, 255*x/256^2 bytes will be needed for the crc and
//x/256^2 bytes will be available for the metadata. Since there are 32 bytes of
//metadata x must fulfill x >= 2097152. To keep things evenly dividable then x
//must also be divisible by 256^2
